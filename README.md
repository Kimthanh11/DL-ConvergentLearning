# 🧠 Convergent Learning (Modified Version)

This project is based on the original implementation from  
🔗 [YixuanLi/convergent_learning](https://github.com/YixuanLi/convergent_learning)

It investigates whether different neural networks learn similar internal representations.

## ✨ What's Different in This Version

- ✅ Simplified to use **only 2 networks**
- 🔄 Replaced the original dataset with **Tiny ImageNet** for smaller-scale experiments
- 📁 Added helper tools and updated structure for easier reproducibility

---

## 📦 Dataset: Tiny ImageNet

This project uses the **Tiny ImageNet** dataset. It is **not included** in this repository due to file size limits.

Please download it manually from Kaggle:

📥 [Tiny ImageNet on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akash2sharma/tiny-imagenet)

After downloading:
1. Extract the folder
2. Rename it (if needed) to `tiny-imagenet-200`
3. Place it in the root directory of this project
